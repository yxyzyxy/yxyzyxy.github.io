This post was motivated by discussions with students and friends who have previously praised my collection of math resources. 

I've listed most typical math courses offered at the university and beginning graduate level that a math student might be expected to know by the completion of their graduate studies, along with textbooks that I've found to be very helpful in either learning the subject or as a resource, if any. 
If you're interested in studying math or a math-adjacent subject, there will be a number of math subjects that you may also be expected to learn (e.g. group theory for particle physics). 


After completing Precalculus (or College Algebra with Trigonometry), a math student will then go on to take
  * Calculus 1 or AP Calculus AB/BC in high school
  * Calculus 2 (Calc BC covers many of the topics in a calculus 2 course)
  * Calculus 3/Multivariable Calculus or Vector Calculus, this course requires some knowledge of linear algebra
  * (introductory) Linear Algebra

The next step is typically going to be a more *proof*-based course (somewhat like in HS Geometry) that exercises logic and writing like a mathematician. Proof techniques are typically taught in some elementary linear algebra courses, emphasized heavily in most discrete mathematics courses, and some schools have an entirely separate Intro to Proofs course. Most math students will take some mixture of the three, if not all three. There's plenty of excellent resources on writing proofs, but a few that I'm familiar with:
  * **Analysis With An Introduction to Proof** by S. Lay
  * **Introduction to Analysis with Complex Numbers** by I. Swanson

After completing a linear algebra and a vector calculus course, a student should follow whatever graduation requirements are needed to complete their degree- but we can categorize most of the upper-level courses and graduate courses into a few categories: *Analysis, Algebra,* and *Geometry*. 
However, modern mathematics requires a broad knowledge of techniques from different branches of math (collaboration with others is crucial for STEM research) so these subjects should not viewed as wholly separate despite these subjects being divided up into different branches. Listed below are "broad" subjects/classes that many universities in the US list on the curriculum that a math student may take that would not be listed as a topics course (e.g. modular forms, Riemann surfaces, hyperplane arrangements, quadratic and bilinear forms, etc.).
