This Number Theory club was originally designed to be a course for Valley Christian High School with the curriculum submitted for approval in November 2023. 
The outline of the original curriculum can be seen [here](/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ne1c233y4hl0rM7Jk2S9uBU92W3iSae0/view?usp=sharing)

  
As a club, we will work through story and most of the exercises provided by the textbook "Number Theory" by Pommersheim, Marks, and Flapan.
The goal is for you to learn how to approach math creatively through number theory, and see how we can apply mathematical ideas to crytography.

Sample problems that you'll eventually learn how to tackle:
  1. Prove that $3^{512}$ has a remainder of 0 when divided by 1024.
  2. Find the last 3 digits of $2025^{2024^{2023}}$.
  3. Does the function $f(x) = x^2 + x + 41$ always spit out primes for positive integers $x$? 
  4. A composite number n is called a psuedoprime to base b if gcd(b,n) = 1 and $b^{n-1} -1$ is divisible by $n$. Prove that 1729 is a pseudoprime to bases 2,3, and 5.
  5. How do the rational points on the unit circle parametrize all Pythagorean triples?
  6. For any given year, the Doomsday is defined as the day of the week of the last day of February in that year (e.g. Doomsday of 2007 is Wednesday since the last day of February 2007 was Wednesday, February 28.) Find the Doomsday of 2025 and the Doomsday of 6512. 

Some particular types of encryption:
  1. Caesar ciphers
  2. Exponentiation
  3. RSA Encryption algorithm (public and private key)
  5. Elliptic Curves (if time permits)
We will have to learn how to program a bit in either Python or Sage to do the RSA encryption algorithms.
