> There is hardly any theory which is more elementary (than linear algebra), in spite of the fact that generations of professors and textbook writers have obscured its simplicity by preposterous calculations with matrices.
-Jean DieudonnÃ©

>It is my experience that proofs involving matrices can be shortened by 50% if one throws the matrices out.
-Emil Artin

Linear algebra is the study of abstract (finite-dimensional) vector spaces and their applications. 
This is a year-long independent study (not graded) course on linear algebra. 
The goal of this course would be to prepare you for an advanced linear algebra course at the university level.
The expectation is that you commit at least 10 hours/week on understanding, working through, and writing up problem sets. 
You are encouraged to work together, collaborate, and ask questions- but please work with a problem for at least 30 minutes before asking for help.

There are no graded exams, but it is expected that by the end of May that you are able to work through a linear algebra exam one might see in university.
