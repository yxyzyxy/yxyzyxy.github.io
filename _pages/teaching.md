# Teaching elsewhere
At UC Santa Cruz, I was a teaching assistant for Math 11A and Math 11B Calculus with Applications, taught by Prof. Martin Weissman and Prof. Andrew Korbin, respectively. 
During my final year at Reed College, I was a course assistant for Math 111 Calculus taught by Prof. Jerry Shurman and the course assistant for Math 201 Linear Algebra, taught by Prof. Dave Perkinson. 
I've also tutored and graded coursework for a variety of math courses, ranging from calculus to abstract algebra.
