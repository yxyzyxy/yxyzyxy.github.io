Most recently, I have been interested in algebraic geometry, representation theory, and category theory. 
Below, you will find my [research papers](#research-papers), my [expository writing](#expository-writing), and [recent talks](#recent-talks).

## research papers

* **Biased permutative equivariant categories**.  
[Homology, Homotopy and Applications](http://dx.doi.org/10.4310/HHA.2021.v23.n1.a6). [arXiv:1907.00933](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00933).
  <details>
  <summary>Abstract and coauthors.</summary>

    For a finite group $G$, we introduce the complete suboperad $\mathcal QG$ of the categorical $G$-Barratt-Eccles operad $\mathcal PG$. We prove that $\mathcal PG$ is not finitely generated, but $\mathcal QG$ is finitely generated and is a genuine $E_\infty$ $G$-operad (i.e., it is $N_\infty$ and includes all norms). For $G$ cyclic of order 2 or 3, we determine presentations of the object operad of $\mathcal QG$ and conclude with a discussion of algebras over $\mathcal QG$, which we call biased permutative equivariant categories. (With Kayleigh Bangs, Skye Binegar, Kyle Ormsby, Angélica M. Osorno, David Tamas-Parris, and Livia Xu.)

* **An Analogue of k-marked Durfee symbols for strongly unimodal sequences**.  
[Integers 21](http://math.colgate.edu/~integers/vol21.html). [arXiv:2009.10850](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10850).

    In a seminal 2007 paper, Andrews introduced a class of combinatorial objects that generalize partitions called $k$-marked Durfee symbols. Multivariate rank generating functions for these objects have been shown by many to have interesting modularity properties at certain vectors of roots of unity. 
    Motivated by recent studies of rank generating functions for strongly unimodal sequences, we apply methods of Andrews to define an analogous class of combinatorial objects called k-marked strongly unimodal symbols that generalize strongly unimodal sequences. 
    We establish a multivariate rank generating function for these objects, which we study combinatorially. We conclude by discussing potential quantum modularity properties for this rank generating function at certain vectors of roots of unity. (With Savana Ammons, Laura Seaberg, and Holly Swisher.)

## expository writing

* **Resolutions of Rees Algebras**.  
[PDF](/files/Kim_Young_Jin_2020_thesis.pdf).
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract.</summary>
    
    My undergraduate thesis, advised by Prof. Irena Swanson.
    We relate the Rees algebra of an ideal $I$ to the syzygy of a graded module by looking at the minimal graded free resolutions of the ideal $I$ and trimming degree- $d$ strands of these resolutions, resulting in an upper bound on the Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity of $I^d$.

* **Quantum Algorithm for Pell's Equation**.  
[PDF](/files/quantumwriteup.pdf).
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract.</summary>
    
  Expository notes on Hallgren's quantum algorithm for solving a quadratic diophantine equation (Pell's equation). Using a quantum Fourier transform over finitely generated abelian groups, Hallgren extended the Hidden Subgroup Problem to $\mathbb R$ and produced a quantum algorithm for Pell's equation that can be done in polynomial time.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract.</summary>
  
   Notes on synthetic differential geometry and how basic results in calculus can be somewhat recovered using intuitionistic logic. Supervised by Prof. Kálmán Cziszter.

[PDF](/files/quadratic_TNR.pdf).

    <summary>Abstract.</summary>

   Notes on complex representations of $GL(2, \mathbb F_q )$ using parabolic induction and the Principal Series representation. Currently being rewritten.

## recent talks
* **Elliptic Functions, Curves, and Modular Forms**, 10 April 2018.  [Notes](/files/elliptictalk.pdf), [PDF](/files/ellipticabstract.pdf).
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract.</summary>

   Elliptic functions are of an interest to many branches of mathematics. They have many
fascinating properties, have deep connections with combinatorics and number theory, and even
have a practical use in evaluating integrals and provide explicit solutions to certain differential
equations. In this talk, we will introduce the concept of elliptic functions and explore some of
their properties. This will give rise to a discussion about elliptic curves and their structure and
through this, we aim to motivate an elementary introduction to the theory of modular forms.

* **A Hitchhikers Guide to Riemann Surface Theory**, 2 December 2019. [Notes](/files/rstalknotes.pdf), [PDF](/files/rstalkabstract.pdf).
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract.</summary>

   Riemann surfaces are one-dimensional complex manifolds and arise quite naturally as covering
spaces. Moreover, every compact Riemann surface is obtained from an algebraic equation! In
this talk, we go through basic examples and properties of Riemann surfaces, building up to
the Riemann-Hurwitz formula and the Riemann-Roch theorem. We will then show a few
applications of these results. If time permits, we may also discuss the Abel-Jacobi theorem.
Familiarity with complex analysis will be helpful, but will not be necessary.
