Hello! I am a math teacher at [Valley Christian Schools](https://valleychristianschools.org/). I was a graduate student in math at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.math.ucsc.edu/index.html) after completing my undergraduate studies at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/math/). I've also had the opportunity to be a part of the [Budapest Semesters in Mathematics](https://budapestsemesters.com/) and the [Math in Moscow](https://mathinmoscow.org/) study abroad programs. You can find more details about my math work and publications in the [math stuff](/math/) page or the [blog](/blog/), but generally, I like [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense).

You can contact me by emailing me at ykim at valleychristianschools dot org. 
If I don't respond within 48 hours, try resending your email.

If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be Saunders Mac Lane's <b><i>Categories for the Working Mathematician</i></b>.
I provide an array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields.  Starting from foundations, I illuminate the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality.
I then turn to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representation of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits.
